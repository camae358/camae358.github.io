<h1>THE GREAT FILTER

				The Great Filter is one possible explanation as to why we have yet to encounter extraterrestrial life.
			            Every advanced civilization encounters a point in time where they have to face the environmental
			          ramifications of technological advancement. Simply put, every advanced form of life has destroyed
			          themselves before achieving interstellar travel. It is unclear whether or not we have passed this
				      threshold. If the filter is behind us, it means life is extremely rare. Alternatively, if the
				         filter is ahead of us, it means humanity will suffer a great collapse in the near future.
				        It has taken 200,000 years to evolve from primitive tools to this advanced civilization.
				             Some believe that the path to self destruction is inevitable once a species gains
					          control over its planet. The most likely situation is that species with
					               the ability to gain control of their planet destroy it in the
					                     process of competing over resources. If we were
					                       to discover extraterrestrial life, the odds
						                     we have yet to encounter the great
						                        filter will vary based on how
						                          advanced these species are.
